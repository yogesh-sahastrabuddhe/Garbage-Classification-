```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(f'TensorFlow: {tf.__version__}')"
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the Model

```bash
python garbage_classification.py
```

The script will:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Create advanced data generators with augmentation
3. Build the enhanced EfficientNetV2L model
4. Train with advanced techniques
5. Fine-tune the model

## 🔧 Configuration

### Key Parameters

```python
IMG_SIZE = (380, 380)      # Image size for EfficientNetV2L
BATCH_SIZE = 12           # Adjusted for memory efficiency
EPOCHS = 25               # Initial training epochs
FINE_TUNE_EPOCHS = 20     # Fine-tuning epochs
```

### Advanced Settings

- **Attention mechanisms**: Channel and Spatial attention
- **Augmentation probability**: 30-50% for various transforms
- **Learning rate**: 0.001 initial, 5e-6 for fine-tuning
- **Label smoothing**: 0.1 for training, 0.05 for fine-tuning

## 📈 Training Process

### Phase 1: Initial Training
- Freeze EfficientNetV2L backbone
- Train classification head with metadata
- Use advanced augmentations and MixUp/CutMix
- Monitor with early stopping

### Phase 2: Fine-tuning
- Unfreeze top layers of EfficientNetV2L
- Lower learning rate (5e-6)
- Reduced label smoothing (0.05)
- Focus on feature adaptation

### Phase 3: Evaluation
- Test Time Augmentation (TTA)
- Multiple augmented predictions
- Ensemble averaging
- Comprehensive metrics
